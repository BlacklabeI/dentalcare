Next we set up virtualenvironment. Open git bash on windows start button
    Type ls to view current location/folder

    ls again.
    type "pip install virtualenv"
    type "virtualenv venv"
    type "source venv/Scripts/activate" to activate the environment. You will notice a change on top of the command
